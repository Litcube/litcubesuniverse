When an M8's missile turret is set to _Missiles Only_, it will monitor all ships (of the same race) within the chaff's range, which is about 20 km.

If any missiles are targeting a monitored ship, the M8 will fire a chaff at the incoming missile.  Chaff are no ordinary missiles; they're lightning quick, and carry a very generous proximity fuse.  Any missile that comes within a few hundred meters of a chaff is destroyed.

As an added benefit to the upgraded chaff missile, when fired, they will target the nearest incoming missile, regardless of current target.
