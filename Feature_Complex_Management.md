# Complex Management #

This page is for vanilla style complexes, and **_not_** the Saturn Complex Hubs.  Just a few features to make your life easier when managing them at the same time as you're using Station Agents and Couriers.

## Set Station Product ##

Set station product does exactly as it says.  The command can only be run on a complex hub, and allows you to set the products of the station.  You can remove products as well, as long as they are a resource already.

## Station Parameters ##

A station parameter exists that allows you to set intermediates to buy, sell, buy & sell, or none.

The Station Agent respects these.

Senario:  You want your homebase to buy resources and intermediates, but not sell them.  Also sell products:

Add the products you want to sell using the Set Station Product command.
