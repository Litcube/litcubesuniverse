# GoD Changes #


_(GoD is a German acronym for "Global Decision Engine")_

Ships no longer spawn out of thin air.  They will spawn only in their respective race's shipyards.

TLs will build stations anywhere in the universe, but they do need to travel there.

The jobs engine has also been rewritten, with a few added benefits.  All variants of ships are chosen.  In vanilla, only the first found ship with a matching variant was used, even if the race has several variants within the same class.
