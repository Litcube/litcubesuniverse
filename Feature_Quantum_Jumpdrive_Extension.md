This is the jump menu when you have a Quantum Jumpdrive Extension installed on a ship:

As you can see from the above image, when the pricey extension is installed on your ship you have a few new jump options available in the sector map.  In addition to the gates, you can now jump to jump beacons and sector centres. If you're on good terms with a jump beacon's race, the jump beacon becomes a jump option.  The sector center is always available, provided the Quantum Jumpdrive Extension is installed.

AI ships will always use the closest jump point to their destination, which is why it's a good idea to fit trader ships with a Quantum Jumpdrive Extension when you can afford it.  It can cut down jump times [considerably](03_FAQ#Is_there_any_way_that_I_can_improve_UT_effectiveness?.md), when centre sector and available jumpbeacons are available.

You can, of course, place your own jump beacons.  Though prohibitively expensive, they can increase the efficiency of your trading network.  Even if the beacon is owned by you, a Quantum Jumpdrive Extension is still necessary to use them.
