# What Is EMS? #
## Overview ##

EMS, meaning Emergent Mission System - is LU's official replacement mission system for vanilla missions as well as a unique mission framework for use by anyone to create missions within the MSCI.

## What Makes EMS Unique? ##

EMS aims to make missions emergent within the universe, this means that rather then fly around from sector to sector contacting mission agents
you may discover missions while exploring purely out of the events that occur in the universe. Standard game play such as repelling a Xenon invasion becomes a mission, rather then spawning a group of random enemy's when you accept a mission EMS watches for what already happens in the universe to generate content for you.

EMS is not limited to only combat missions, coming in future updates are Trade and Build missions, special OCV missions and Exploration missions. EMS is also capable of creating story missions, if someone ever writes an actual plotline.

EMS Also aims to eliminate the use of Menus as much as possible when dealing with missions.

## What to Expect ##

In keeping with the harsh nature of LU, EMS, unlike the standard mission system, will not hand you anything on silver platters. It is up to you to find missions in the game world, you must explore to do this in both hostile and friendly space.

If your an avid mission runner, EMS will drastically change your game play, providing emergent experience throughout the game via event scanning - this should create a more believable atmosphere within the game as EMS will not spawn enemies for the soul purpose of letting the player kill them.

This is just the begining
EMS is in its infancy, Its current mission set are the basics required for release but its event scanner will be updated and improved over the coarse of EMS's lifetime, New missions will be added as well as new functionality to improve the amount of events happening in the universe.

## Hoes does EMS work? ##

So, you may be asking, if you never use a menu and accept a mission, how do you - well, accept a mission?

The answer is you dont, Not in the same sense as what you do currently. In your travels you will come across missions, these missions will be displayed in a brand new interface on the right side of the screen (See Fig 1a). The new interface will tell you a brief description of what is involved in the missions and its your choice to act on that mission, or not.

You are given the choice - Do, or Do Not (There is no try!). If you do, you are rewarded, if you do not - shame on you for letting that poor transport die.

Of course, some missions do need some sort of menu, such as to buy a ship - These missions will have menus that give the most information without fuss in the simplest menu possible and will be accessible via a universal hot-key that is context sensitive to the object your targeting.

## Why a seperate download? ##
Why is EMS a seperate download and not built into the LUV base package?

EMS contains several incompatibilities, Other mission systems (including the vanilla mission system which gets disabled when you install EMS) can cause problems when EMS is installed - Best effort will be made and is being made now and into the future to allow for EMS to work along side other systems. The reason this incompatibility exists is because EMS scans the universe for events, events such as hostile ships in friendly space. If such events are caused by other mission systems and these other mission systems also provide a reward system for these events, EMS and the other script will both start rewarding the player for doing the same thing, creating an imbalance in the system. There are several ways to combat this but they will be outlined in future technical documentation.

The other reason for separating EMS from the LU core download is that EMS currently only functions on windows versions of the game, this is due to how EMS renders its new UI - However, it should still function under Wine. This questionable multi-platform support is the main reason for the seperate download, in the future we hope to have a Linux native solution but that wont be for some time yet.

While EMS is an addon download, full support will be given to users running EMS as if they were running LUV. Please make note of the fact that you're using EMS in you're save games that get posted as part of bug reports so that they may be properly debugged.
