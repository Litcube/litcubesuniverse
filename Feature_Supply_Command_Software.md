# Supply Command Software Update #

I did enjoy the vanilla version of Supply Command Software, but I felt it required a few changes.

It enables you to do the following with your ship:

## Supply Ware ##

In this scenario, once activated, the ship will purchase 31 PACs and load them on the selected Emeus with the transporter device.  If _supply entire formation_ is set to _yes_, the ship will supply the target ship and all of the ships that are following the target ship.

# Template Outfit #

Above, you'll see the template outfit command for the Supply Command software.  With this command, your ship will outfit the target ship with all wares in the selected template (see: [Template Manager](Feature_Template_Manager.md)).  Once the command is completed, the target ship will install all wares, and configuration will match the template requested.  If _supply entire formation_ is set to _yes_, the ship will outfit the target ship and all of the ships that are following the target ship with the requested template.
