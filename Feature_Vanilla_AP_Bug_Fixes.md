Several changes have been made to fix certain bugs found in the unmodified version of X3: Albion Prelude.

  * Ships now respond properly to SIGNAL\_ATTACKED from attacks from Pirate race owned ships

  * Jobs now properly select all variants of a ship class when choosing a ship for a job

  * Several scene and model issues have been fixed with ships (misaligned turrets)

  * Mission spawned pirate ships no longer have inactive turrets.
