This command, run on the player ship, lets you find stuff for sale so that you don't have to ask me where to find it.  It'll look for wares, ships, or stations for sale in the entire Universe.

In order for the product to be searchable, you need to _know_ of the station's existence, and have PPP.

Mode has two settings.  Price will allow you to search for the best buy or sell price.  Availability will search for the highest amount available at a station when searching for a buy, and the least amount when searching for a sale.

Wares required for the command to show up in the _Trade_ menu can be found in the [Feature_Encyclopedia_Update encyclopedia] under _Software and equipment commands_.
