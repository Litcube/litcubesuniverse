When I first read DrBullwinkle saying that XRM was not a good start for a beginner, because of the fast pace and the overhaul balance,I was sceptic. I mean, there are a lot of cool stuff and great features in XRM, and I didn't see, considering all problems of the vanilla game, how this was not a good starter mod. 

Then comes Litcube and his "mod". Well, "mod" is not the right word, it's more like a big patch, improving the vanilla game at a new vanilla state, like an AP 4.0.

A novice would probably not see any differences in the first minutes of playing (except for the new UI). Why ? Because it's very well thought, and above all, it has the original spirit of the game. But this spirit has been used to build a lot less frustrated game, balanced and very rewarding. The pace is very slow : switching from an M4 to an M3 is a noticable step in your space adventure, and that's good! Combats are here to remind you that you are a noob ; all weapons can be deadly if you know how to aim, but recharge rates (shields and lasers) have been decreased, leading to very tactic dogfights. You think you can beat those 3 M5 with your M4 ? Well, think twice, even those can destroy a M3 in no time. In fact, as soon as you are two against one, it can be difficult, because you can't fire all your weapons all the time without being worried by the cool down of your weapons and the slow recharge rate of your shields. Straffing is no more a life saver and using weapon groups is very important. Furthermore, Litcube has modified the fire rate of weapons (DPS), which force you to aim properly, and that nuances the advantage of human vs AI. In short, combats are smart ! 

Early games are no more boring and hopeless ; you have used ships that you can repair and resell, the perfect amount of pirates to loot some wares (yes, there is loot!), some very rewarding transport missions that justify the purchase of a TP, and more peaceful asteroids scan missions. It's just enough to start an empire. After that, you will have so many things to do that missions will be of no interest to you. Because, as you suspect, LU is not about early games, but managing a giant empire against two major threat : a greedy corporation and a strong relentless invader. Personally, I think pirates are also a real threat that you should eradicate ASAP (note that 
destroying shipyards have now a real effect on ships spawning). 

So like in the vanilla game, building a strong satellite network and train Universal Traders are still priorities. But now you have automatic explorers, who can buy and deploy satellites on their own. Most importantly, traders and every "automatic ships" respond to a new system that will save you from rage, violence against your pets and cancer. In a nutshell, every ships, especially UTs, won't go where they don't see. That generally means that if you have no satellites, then you have no view on stations, so you can't trade with them. Besides, if they have a visual, but if they detect hostile ships, they don't go either. They will trade somewhere else, and be kind enough to report what they saw, in case you have some security ships ready to intervene and destroy the threat (it is called the "Military Logistics & Command Software", a tool to organize some Rapid Response Fighters of your own). Many tools exist to ease the empire management, like quickshuttles (refuel and loot with one hotkey and a preconfigured ship) and Saturn Complexes, which can contain several factories to produce a single product. In other word, a smart complex. These tools can sometimes be hard to manipulate or understand, but 
that's because they are powerful and only make sense when you have many assets. 

Technically, it's very impressive. No lag in big combats, faster loading, and all of that with a default SETA at 1000% and an integrated Bounce, which removes this very high frustration of seeing your ships exploding in a collision with other ships. A lot of minor things, details, has been changed or added, like the SETA not being stopped automatically when your ship is too close to an object, the ability to always see the ship type of your target (otherwise, it was impossible to see when it was not mentioned into the ship's name) or the in-game menu that let you compare every ships of the universe. 

So everything is good in this best of all possible worlds ? Well, some X3 limits are still there (and that would take a new game to bypass them), and a better, increased documentation (an in-game one maybe) would be appreciable, especially for new players (even average ones). Also, some things could be polished even more, like aliased new menu icons. 

But this is a must-have, undoubtedly. Before LU, I was playing with about 30 scripts and librairies. Today I have 4 (and they're really not essential), and I enjoy the game a lot more. 
It's the real rebirth.

I played XRM a little, but Litecubes Universe SAVED X3 for me. There is so much to love about LU but what absolutly saved my game was Revelation and Phanon. LU was devolped around the question "What now?" By that I mean Litecube found that he had massive economy and massive fleets in his vanilla game but nothing to do with them. So he made this mod. 

Revelation adds the OCV, think Xenon on crack with a grudge against the entire X universe. They start out on the far end of the galaxy and then slowly over time build and conquer, and unless YOU stop them they will take over everything. 

Phanon Co. I think of as your evil twin brother. They possess the ability to do everything you do and a grudge out for you personally. They start out with just a few assests and build on that over time untill they start sending out hunter/killer fleets with your forehead on a wanted sign. (right now in my game I am to the point of facing M6 + escort up to 10 fighters that explorer around rthe galaxy hunting my shit and I have to stop them before they get there... really exciting BTW) 

But what SAVED the game for me is the feel, the immersion. I lost immersion with x3 when i realised that i could save my game fly out to the end of a secotr and then SETA for days at a time, earn massive money and then buy big toys. AND IT KILLED THE GAME FOR ME. In LU if you tried to do that you would literally be hunted down and killed. You also have a feeling of time constraints. The bad guys are slowly getting bigger and bigger and if you don't match or exceed that then you will end up up a creek with out a paddle. 

The really exciting part is this is just a scratch in the surface of LU. There are new toys, empire management, new ships, new guns, new everything. 

On top of everything else LU is made to be very CPU friendly, actually more friendly then vanilla. When I played XRM my computer was bearly able to play it (it adds a lot after all). With LU my computer plays it flawlessly. 

I have links to the LU thread and the LU wiki in my sig. as well as a DiD I am currently writing in LU. Note: if you read the DiD know that I started out on the hardest setting when you litterally start out with nothing.
