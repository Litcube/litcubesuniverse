#summary Missile boats are very effective at protecting ships from missiles

= Missile Boat Missile Defence =

When an M8's missile turret is set to _Missiles Only_, it will monitor all ships (of the same race) within the mosquito missile's range, which is about 20 km.

If any missiles are targeting a monitored ship, the M8 will fire a mosquito at the incoming missile.  Mosquitoes are no ordinary missiles; they're lightning quick, and carry a very generous proximity fuse.  Any missile that comes within a few hundred meters of a mosquito is destroyed.

As an added benefit to the upgraded mosquito missile, when fired, they will target the nearest incoming missile, regardless of current target.
