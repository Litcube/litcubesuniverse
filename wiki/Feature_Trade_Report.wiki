Tahlmorra requested trade reports, and got trade reports.  Ad nauseum.

There's now trade reports for everything.  All your ships now carry a trade report that can be accessed from the _ship_ menu.  The reports are generated when _anything_ you own buys or sells something.

Stations also have trade reports, and they're generated by any ship that has the homebase set to it or NPC trades.

You will always carry around the same trade report, regardless of changing to a new ship.
