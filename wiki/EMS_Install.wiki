Install Checklist:
 Please run through the install checklist every time you wish to update EMS, as some requirements may change. Also please check to see if EMS has been updated every time you update LU.
  * Ensure you are running LU *Version 1.4.6* or later.
  * Ensure you have installed a GUI from GUI Installer *Version 1.2.3* or later.
 If you meet the above requirements, simply download the EMS installer. The EMS installer will ask you to select a GUI version, select the same GUI version you installed via the LU GUI installer previously.
 If you wish to switch GUI in the future, please re-run the LU GUI installer and the EMS installer.

After installing EMS, be sure to bind the "EMS: Action" hotkey, this is multi-function hotkey used by EMS, you will receive visual feedback on screen when an action is available.

= ENB Details =
EMS currently does not support ENB's, if you use a graphics mod such as SweetFX EMS will override the mod's core d3d9.dll file, rendering it inoperable. I will try to fix this after release if it becomes an issue.
