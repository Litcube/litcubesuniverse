#summary Universal Bailing.

= Universal Bailing =

LU has a universal bailing mechanic that completely replaces vanilla bailing.

== Bailing ==

Bailing has been changes in fundamental ways:
  * Overall bail chance has been decreased.
  * All ships not owned by the player can now bail.
  * All ships can now cause a bail to occur.
  * Each ship class has its own (slightly random) maximum hull strength before they have a chance to bail (larger ships have a lower threshold than smaller ones).
  * Bail chance is dependent on four factors
    # Ship Class
    # Pilot Moral
    # Hull Strength
    # Relative combat strength between the attacking and bailing ship

== Salvagers ==

NPC Salvagers have been added the the universe. Salvagers fly around collecting bailed ships and dropped cargo containers. These included the freebies spawned at the start of a new game (although they don't cheat and must see the freebie before collecting it).

Things to keep in mind regarding NPC Salvagers:
  * They WILL take your hard earned loot if you delay in picking it up!
  * You CAN blow the hell out of them before they do (if you don't mind the rep penalty)!
