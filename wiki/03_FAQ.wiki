=== Is XYZ mod compatible with LU? ===

I don't know.  I only wrote LU, I didn't write any of the other mods, so I can't help you there.

(I mean, really, how the fuck am I supposed to know?  Install it, play it for a time, and report back to you?)

<br/>
----
=== Can you make XYZ feature available as a standalone? ===

Fuck off.

<br/>
----
=== What wares do I need installed to enable XYZ command? ===

Check the encyclopedia under [Feature_Encyclopedia_Update Software and equipment commands].

<br/>
----
=== Where do I find XYZ ware?  I've searched everywhere and I can't find it for sale ===

[Feature_Trade_Product_Search Trade Product Search]

== Comparisons ==
----
=== How does LU compare to the vanilla game? ===
Compared to vanilla, LU has improved [04_Features everything] but has eliminated the plots. There also is no kha'ak, aldrin sectors, nor unfocussed jump drive.

Enemies are tougher, but can still be defeated through skillful flying. It is reasonably well-[Feature_Balance  balanced] that way (so far).

Instead of a plot, there are two factions ([Feature_Revelation OCV] and [Feature_The_Phanon_Corporation Phanon]) that grow over time, becoming more threatening enemies as they grow. Your job, should you choose to accept it, is to overcome these enemies by building up your own empire quickly enough to be able to beat them.

It is a slower paced strategy game with very sophisticated opponents.

<br/>
----
=== How does LU compare to the X Rebalanced Mod, XRM? ===

It's just different.  Personally, I think XRM is a fantastic mod, and Paul has been very successful implementing his vision of the game.

<br/>
----

=== How does Out-Of-Sector (OOS) combat compare to vanilla? ===

OOS combat is the same as the latest patched vanilla.

I find it to be a reasonable facsimile of IS combat.

<br/>
----

=== How does In-Sector (IS) combat compare to vanilla? ===

You'll find the IS battles in LU to be "bigger".  The fights last longer, especially between larger ships, and there's usually more ships involved.

You could be minding your own business in a sector, and a pirate patrol of an M7, a few M6, and a giant wing of fighters wants your cargo.

So be aware of that.

<br/>
----
=== How does race rep compare to vanilla? ===

Station granted missions have lower rep rewards than vanilla.

<br/>
----
=== How does the Stock Exchange compare to vanilla? ===

I also wrote a [Feature_Stock_Exchange stock exchange] from scratch.  It uses the current stock exchange stations to unlock them, much like vanilla.  It's [Feature_Hotkeys hotkey] operated.

One thing I found during the late game, is that I was going through billions of credits.  My system was so automated, that I didn't realize it, but as I'd jump in to fight off an OCV invasion, I'd lose hundreds of fully equipped fighters, vanguard M6s, etc.  They would auto re-populate from the [Feature_MLCC MMLC] settings, but I'd still need to provide the resources for it.

My job became an empire manager.

So, yes, you can rake in huge credits from the new stock exchange, but a) it requires serious investment, and b) you'll never run out of uses for those credits.

<br/>
----
===  I am new-ish to the X-verse. Will I be able to handle LU? ===

Maybe.

Letting your game SETA overnight while your two UTs make money is unlikely a viable strategy now. 

It's meant to be an epic campaign, so you're not going to lose in the span of a few days.

<br/>
----

=== It sounds as though this game can now definitely be "lost". And, inevitably will be, unless you're competent. Yes? ===

Yes. Winning takes some skill and planning, over a long period of time. Strategy is much more important than it is in the vanilla game.


<br/>
----
=== Do we need to absolutely expand as fast as the game allows, or can we afford to make a few mistakes and expand at a slightly slower rate and still be able to fight the enemy factions? ===

The latter.  It's not a huge panic race against time, but there is a slight sense of urgency.  You'll get messages time to time to let you know what's happening in the Universe.

However, running SETA run over night to have your 1 UT gain you millions probably isn't a good idea.

<br/>
----


== Traders ==
----
=== How about Universe Traders? Are they better than vanilla UT's? ===

Universe Traders (UTs) will not jump into sectors where you have an enemy on scanner. So satellites are your friends.

Another thing to note, trade can't happen for the player unless there's property present in the sector.  In LU, it works the same for your AI ships.

A lot of the script commands have been implemented to reflect this.  I've added script flags of [respect PPP] which basically means, respect the Player Property Present rule when searching for objects or trades.

If a UT finds an enemy where there is a lucrative trade deal, it will ignore it, but log it with the Complaint Department (Managed by Helen Wayte).  You can view trader complaints in the player menu ([Feature_Hotkeys hotkey] accessible).  It will let you know here the threat is, and why it's ignoring that sweat deal.  Not only UTs will do this, but also the Station Agents, Vend traders, Dock Agents, or any other trader you have for AI.  They all use the same system.

For example, if you have no assets in Argon Prime, then none of your traders will search there for deals or treat it as a viable trading opportunity.

You can't "log into the trading network" when there's no property in the sector. It's been that way since X2 for the player.  It was only the invention of the UT script that broke a bunch of rules.

=== Where is a good place to train Universe Traders? ===
  * Blue Storm
  * Creditania
  * Far Point
  * Scion Fire
  * Overmasters

Also:
  * CEO's Sprite
  * Empire's Edge
  * Home of Light
  * Omicron Lyrae
  * Scale Plate Green
  * Seizewell

<br/>
----
=== Can I defend my traders? ===

Helen Wayte, Manager of the Complaints Department, has this to say:

_"Of course, we don't like it when scurvy pie-rats or other troublemakers attempt to interfere with our customers who are just trying to make a living transporting goods. So we forward complaints to the Military Logistics and Control Center (MLCC). If you have sufficiently developed your fleet (and set up MLCC appropriately), then the MLCC can send a wing of fighters to 'discourage' unwanted aggression toward our customers."_


<br/>
----
=== It sounds like Universe Traders won't trade hardly anywhere at the beginning of the game. What do I have to do to get "assets"? Satellites? ===

Yes. Satellites.

<br/>
----
=== Is there an easy way to develop a satellite network? ===

Explorer Command Software can be installed on a ship.  It allows for the command "Deploy Satellites".

There's a bunch of options for it.  A single, a box, pick up at home, etc. etc.

However, it can be costly, those satellites.  So you'll have to have some capital handy, or an income.


<br/>
----
=== Speaking of Explorers, what is the option "Remember last position?" in the Explorer menu? ===

If "Remember last position" is ON, the explorer will go back to the last place he dropped a sat to search for the closest unplaced sat from wherever he is when he just finished what he's doing (placed a sat, bought sats).  If remember last position is OFF, he will search for closest unplaced sat from wherever he is when he just finished what he's doing (placed a sat, bought sats)

Whether to turn it ON or OFF depends on circumstances. If I'm trying to concentrate on an area, for example, I need Spectre missiles, and I need that Terran space laid, I'll fly a few to Mars, for example, and then I'd turn it on.  Because if they have to fly to Teladi space (once they run out of sats) to pick up sats, I want them coming back to Mars to keep laying sats.

== Early-Game ==
----
=== I have several UT's, but I am chronically broke. I never have any cash on hand. What to do? ===

Be smarter.
<br/>
----
=== What "hidden costs" should I watch for? ===

Explorers laying a satellite network burn up a lot of cash quickly. Very quickly.

<br/>
----

=== Is there any way that I can improve UT effectiveness? ===

Equip your UTs with [Feature_Jumpgate_Quantifier Jump Drive Quantifiers]. Set their Autojump minimum range to 0.

They will make about half of their trades in half the time. So like a 25% increase in credits-per-hour.

<br/>
----
=== What is the best way to find abandoned ships in LU? I mean, do they randomly spawn? ===

They don't randomly spawn.  If you place satellites in a sector, you'll have a better chance to spot them.  There's also a [Feature_Hotkeys  hotkey] that can auto target abandoned ships but only if it's within scanner range of any of your property.

== OCV (Revelations) Q&A ==

_See Also: [Feature_Revelation]_
----
=== Does killing an OCV enemy hurt them realistically (financially) like in Phanon corp? If I take back a sector, do they lose resources? ===

Yes.  They produce resources in the OCV's home sector of which there is one.  The resources are produced at a steady tick.

Each sector that the OCV takes over builds a single station near the centre of that sector.  That station needs resources to build ships, and thusly invade other neighbouring sectors.  To get those resources, 4 M4 fighters (per OCV occupied sector) are used to ferry resources from the nearest OCV station that has some available.  In early OCV life, this will usually be the OCV home world.  These M4 freighters belong to, and only work for, their OCV home base sector station.

These resources are spent to produce ships.  At a certain ship/resource ceiling is hit in the sector, the OCV try to invade/spread.

<br/>
----
=== Are the OCV enemies different than other enemies? ===

Yeah. You'll notice that the OCV ships can't be found anywhere else in the universe. They're special.  They are significantly tougher than other ships of their class.

<br/>
----
=== Regarding Revelation (the OCV): Did you ever fix the thing where the OCV can't spread past Unknown or Xenon sectors? ===

There's only one station that produces the resources required for the OCV to produce ships, and thus spread.  Thats the homeworld of the OCV.

If the homeworld is destroyed, then a new one will emerge from any of the sectors to OCV has.

So, yes, you can cut the head off the snake. But it'll still bite ya! Holding that sector would be really difficult.

<br/>
----
=== Can you "cut off" the OCV supply line by flanking it and taking back sectors away from the front lines, so that supply never reaches new sectors? ===

You'd have incursions from both sides, unless you cut off the supply of resources from the homeworld. That would effectively halt their production beyond that point.

Each sector uses 4 M4 ships to ferry resources from the OCV homeworld sector to the ships home sector station. So all these M4s are flying to the homeworld constantly to pick up resources and bring them back to their sector so they can expand.
