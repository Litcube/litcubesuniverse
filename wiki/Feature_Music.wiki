#summary A word on the music.

= A Word on Music =

Music in Litcube's Universe has changed.  There's now a dedicated track per sector in the \soundtrack folder.

However, you may notice that some music is used more than once.  That's because in the beta testing version, we have access to the epic soundtrack, where there's one unique track per sector, and was handcrafted over many years.

However, you get the public version which is creative commons, and won't get me into trouble.  Most of it is from CCP's soundcloud.  Temmetvince did a pretty good job on it, but suffice it to say, he's still using the epic beta sountrack.  ;)

There's now 42 Combat tracks, as opposed to Vanilla's 5.  However, again, the public version you downloaded recycles the same 5 tracks throughout the 42 mp3 files.  This is again due to the copy right issues.  The epic soundtrack had 42 unique rocking combat tracks.  That's what you get for being a consumer.

The good news is that you can replace these combat tracks and sector tracks without wrecking another part of the game.

In the soundtrack folder:

File format for sectors: *8XXYY.mp3*

Where XX is the sector's two digit _x_ coordinate, and YY is the two digit _y_ coordinate.  Kingdom End: 80000.mp3


For combat tracks: *010XX.mp3*

Where XX is a number from 01 to 42.
