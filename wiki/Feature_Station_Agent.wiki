#summary Station Agents help freighters to support your factories.

_"Station Agent Software provides utilities and integration to a ship's homebase allowing it to manage and sell wares for a station or a complex."_

The Station Agent software allows a ship to manage the wares of its homebase station. The ship can do one of two things: manage goods or sell goods. Manage allows the pilot to purchase goods for the station when it runs low, respecting the station's import parameter. The alternative is selecting a ware, which will allow the agent to sell the specified good, respecting the station's export parameter. Purchasing or selling is always done at the best found price, wherever player property is present to log into the trade network. Pilots increase in agent ranks, which lowers the amount of time spent negotiating product prices.
