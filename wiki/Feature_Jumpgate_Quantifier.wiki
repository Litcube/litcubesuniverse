#summary Jumping has changed.

= Jumpgate Quantifier =

This is the jump menu when you have a jumpgate quantifier installed on a ship:

As you can see from the above image, when the pricy jumpgate quantifier is installed on your ship you have a few new jump options available in the sector map.  In addition to the gates, you can now jump to jump beacons and sector centers. If you're on good terms with a jump beacon's race, the jump beacon becomes a jump option.  The sector center is always available, provided the jumpgate quantifier is installed.

AI ships will always use the closest jump point to their destination, which is why it's a good idea to fit trader ships with a jumpgate quantifier when you can afford it.  It can cut down jump times considerably, when center sector and available jumpbeacons are available.

You can, of course, place your own jump beacons.  Though prohibitively expensive, they can increase the efficiency of your trading network.  Even if the beacon is owned by you, a jumpgate quantifier is still necessary to use them.
