===*Add target selection functionality to escorts ([http://forum.egosoft.com/viewtopic.php?p=4415525#4415525 OP])*===
  Not yet.  There's other ways to accomplish this, and I feel adding this might add a superfluous layer to an already complex system.

===*Max-out/increase speed upgrade use by NPCs ([http://forum.egosoft.com/viewtopic.php?p=4414087&highlight=#4414087 OP])*===
  I don't think so.  It'd just seem weird with every ship in the Universe tuned to 100%.

===*Add weapon generator to Ship Compendium ([http://forum.egosoft.com/viewtopic.php?p=4411782&highlight=#4411782 OP])*===
  Not enough room in the menu.

===*Add required Race Rank to Ship Compendiumâ€™s summary pages ([http://forum.egosoft.com/viewtopic.php?p=4411782&highlight=#4411782 OP])*===
  Not enough room in the menu.

===*Allow all docks selling upgrades to refit multiple ships simultaneously ([http://forum.egosoft.com/viewtopic.php?p=4416678#4416678 OP])*===
  Not worth the work yet.  Dock a ship at a shipyard instead of the dock.

===*Reducing Combat Rank gain from combat drones ([http://forum.egosoft.com/viewtopic.php?p=4415048&highlight=#4415048 OP])*===
  It is vanilla behaviour.

===*Change OCV invasion ship jump order ([http://forum.egosoft.com/viewtopic.php?p=4417319#4417319 OP])*===
  There's a few reasons why it's the way it is: OCV invasion effectiveness, and I think it looks cooler.  That feel when you're losing, after battling capitals for 20 mins, and in the distance, through the gate, pours countless magenta lights.  You know they're coming just to mop up.

===*Add stations built for missions to E/I ([http://forum.egosoft.com/viewtopic.php?p=4416214#4416214 OP])*===
  Vanilla style missions are no longer supported with the coming EMS and Joubarbe's X-Missions.
