== Accepted == 

  * Check the collect wares command (non-quickshuttle version)
        (I had this exact problem with my playership in beta, 
         but I thought it was fixed. Related bug, perhaps? -rocky)

  * When using the special command software to auto collect an astronaut, my ship either slows to 7 mps or 1. It can take over an hour if you are more than 4k from target.

  * Two trading stations in Black Hole Sun?  Intentional?

  * Place station mission briefing is broken.

== Pending ==

  * [03_FAQ#Factories,_Complexes,_and_the_Economy Factories Complexes, and the Economy] is an orphan

  * Can't find GoD (on the major features page, if you look to the left where you can quick select the categories, GoD is missing)

== Rejected ==
