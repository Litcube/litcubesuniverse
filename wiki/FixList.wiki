===*Add target selection functionality to escorts ([http://forum.egosoft.com/viewtopic.php?p=4415525#4415525 OP])*===
  Not yet.  There's other ways to accomplish this, and I feel adding this might add a superfluous layer to an already complex system.

===*Max-out/increase speed upgrade use by NPCs ([http://forum.egosoft.com/viewtopic.php?p=4414087&highlight=#4414087 OP])*===
  I don't think so.  It'd just seem weird with every ship in the Universe tuned to 100%.

===*Add weapon generator to Ship Compendium ([http://forum.egosoft.com/viewtopic.php?p=4411782&highlight=#4411782 OP])*===
  Not enough room in the menu.

===*Add required Race Rank to Ship Compendiumâ€™s summary pages ([http://forum.egosoft.com/viewtopic.php?p=4411782&highlight=#4411782 OP])*===
  Not enough room in the menu.

===*Allow all docks selling upgrades to refit multiple ships simultaneously ([http://forum.egosoft.com/viewtopic.php?p=4416678#4416678 OP])*===
  Not worth the work yet.  Dock a ship at a shipyard instead of the dock.
