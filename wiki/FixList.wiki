= Shit Litcube Needs to Check When He Gets Home =



== Accepted == 

  * Check the collect wares command (non-quickshuttle version)
        (I had this exact problem with my playership in beta, 
         but I thought it was fixed. Related bug, perhaps? -rocky)

  * Two trading stations in Black Hole Sun?  Intentional?

  * The goddamn version still says 1.0.0

== Pending ==

  * Add TL auto station shopping instructions to SCH wiki -rocky

  * [03_FAQ#Factories,_Complexes,_and_the_Economy Factories Complexes, and the Economy] is an orphan

  * Can't find GoD (on the major features page, if you look to the left where you can quick select the categories, GoD is missing)

  * Clicking the TOP hyperlink at the bottom of any page on the wiki takes you to the top of the old wiki, not this one. It's quite jarring.

== Rejected ==
