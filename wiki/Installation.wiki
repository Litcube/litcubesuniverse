== I am a fucking idiot and cannot follow these basic instructions ==

     # I froth at the mouth when people ask me to do something simple, like sit or lie down.
     # I am a consumer at the core, and expect to be spoon fed all the requirements to my goals, especially when it comes to free entertainment someone else produced for said consumption.
     # Litcube cannot help me.

== Sure Signs Your Install is Fucked ==

Due to the number of changes LU makes to the base game, deviating from the instructions listed above will often result in a broken install. Signs your install is broken are:
     # There are .pck files in your ...\addon\scripts directory
     # Your game lags like hell
     # Your ships won't autojump when settings are correct and e-cells present
     # Mammoths, everywhere. So many Mammoths that I could not for the life me
understand how the sky could contain them all yet be so black.

If you have issues with your new LU installation and notice any of the above, please delete your entire X3AP install folder, re-download X3AP from steam, and carefully follow the install instructions above again before making a bug report on the forum.
