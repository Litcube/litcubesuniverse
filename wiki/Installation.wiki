#summary Installation Guide.

= LU Setup Guide =

Welcome to LU! This guide will assist you in making sure you install or patch properly.

== I am starting from scratch on a new game == 

     # Have a clean install ready.  See: [CleanInstall Clean Install]
     # Download the base mod from [DownloadInstructions the downloads page]
     # Install the base mod to your clean install main folder (i.e. C:\X3)
     # Download the soundtrack
     # Install the soundtrack to your clean install main folder (i.e. C:\X3)
     # Download the latest patch





== Installation == 

     # Run the base mod installer. Be sure to read all text the installer displays. It really is important info, we promise!
       * When the installer asks you to point it towards your X3AP install, select the folder that contains the !NoSteam exe you installed in the last section. Do NOT select the addon folder!
       * In my case listed in the last section, I pointed the installer to 'E:\X3AP Installs\LU\x3 terran conflict'.
     # Run the soundtrack installer.
       * Again, when the installer asks you to point it towards your X3AP install, select the folder that contains the !NoSteam exe you installed in the last section.
     # Run any additional installers you read were necessary when you did the requirements check in the first section of this guide (you did do a requirements check, right?).
       * Again, when the installer asks you to point it towards your X3AP install, select the folder that contains the !NoSteam exe you installed in the last section.
     # Run the installer for the latest patch.
       * Again, when the installer asks you to point it towards your X3AP install, select the folder that contains the !NoSteam exe you installed in the last section.
     # Run the game using the !NoSteam exe you installed earlier.
     # Prepare for the onslaught of the OCV! 

== Importing to a new base install from a previous Export ==


     # Install the export/import files to your *existing version* install 
     # Load your game and export 
     # Go to addons\t and move the 8382-L044.xml file somewhere safe. 
     # Install *new version* to a new clean install
     # Install the export/import files to your now *new version* install 
     # Put the 8382-L044.xml file back in addons\t 
     # Start the game and import

== Sure Signs Your Install is Fucked ==

Due to the number of changes LU makes to the base game, deviating from the instructions listed above will often result in a broken install. Signs your install is broken are:
     # There are .pck files in your ...\addon\scripts directory
     # Your game lags like hell
     # Your ships won't autojump when settings are correct and e-cells present
If you have issues with your new LU installation and notice any of the above, please delete your entire X3AP install folder, re-download X3AP from steam, and carefully follow the install instructions above again before making a bug report on the forum.
