*_STRONGLY_* recommend using X-Studio with these instructions.

If your mod has globals or other data that needs to be exported or imported using LU's system, read this thing.

There's three scripts you'll have to copy:

setup.EI.Template<br>
Z.EmpireCopy.Template.Export<br>
Z.EmpireCopy.Template.Import<br><br>

Copy the files.  _Template_ in these files should be renamed to a name that will be consistent with your mods name.  For example, we'll name it _JouXMissions_.  Your files will now be named:

setup.EI.JouXMissions<br>
Z.EmpireCopy.JouXMissions.Export<br>
Z.EmpireCopy.JouXMissions.Import<br><br>

Now open up the setup script.  As it says in the template, change the three arguments of the script.

*Name:* The name we picked.  In this example, it's JouXMissions.
*FileNumber:*  A filename for the export.  LU uses 8382.  Use something higher than 8390.
*PageNumber:*  Use an unused page number.  Somewhere between 8005 and 80100 should do.
