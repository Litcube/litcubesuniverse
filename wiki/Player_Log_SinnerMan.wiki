NEW PLAYTHROUGH with v1.0!

_almost exclusively Terran playthrough_

--------------

=Economy Setup=

Currently, my PHQ is setup in Unknown Sector Epsilon. This is due to it's central location in the universe, as well as the abundance of natural mineral resources. Most of the large mineral formations have been miniaturized by a Hornet Missile equiped TS, leaving a wealth of Ore, Silicon and even some Nvidium available for 

The PHQ will be my central storage location for all ship-building components, missiles, weapons, shields and resources of that nature. Ideally, it will be supplied by my own factories, with limited "Buy" commands issued to the Dock Agents.

==Current Employees==
2x Dock Agents 

4x Freight Transporters

1x Reap/Energy Shuttle

1x Tug

1x Mobile-Mining Ship _"Fortune"_ (Running Drone Mine & Trade)

1x CLS (Transports unsold Ore from MMS _"Fortune"_) 


The Dock agents currently are only selling excess non-Terran equipment that my Reap shuttle brings in as well as Pie-rat ships that are stripped at the PHQ before being recycled.
