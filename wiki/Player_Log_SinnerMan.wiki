NEW PLAYTHROUGH with v1.0!

_almost exclusively Terran playthrough_

--------------

=Economy Setup=

Currently, my PHQ is setup in Unknown Sector Epsilon. This is due to it's central location in the universe, as well as the abundance of natural mineral resources. 

The PHQ will be my central storage location for all ship-building components, missiles, weapons, shields and resources of that nature. Ideally, it will be supplied by my own factories, with limited "Buy" commands issued to the Dock Agents.

==Current Employees==
2x Dock Agents 

4x Freight Transporters

1x Reap/Energy Shuttle

1x Tug

1x Drone Miner (ORE)

1x CLS 

The Dock agents currently are only selling excess non-Terran equipment that my Reap shuttle brings in as well as Pie-rat ships that are stripped at the PHQ before being recycled.

==Saturn Complex Hubs==
