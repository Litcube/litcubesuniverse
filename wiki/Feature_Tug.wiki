The tug command is run on huge ships with a docking bay.  When run, the tug will stay docked at its homebase waiting for you to _flag_ a ship for it.  When the tug sees that you have _flagged a ship for tug_, it'll jump there, pick up the ship (and others you may have flagged in the sector), drop it off at the tug's homebase, and dock again.  This command makes capturing and recycling ships easy.  It's just another quick way to keep your shit together.

There's two ways to flag a ship for tug.

  * Use the hotkey when the ship to be tugged is targeted (under interface)
  * On the ship that needs to be tugged: run _Flag ship for tug_ from the _ship_.

Obviously, the ship to be tugged needs to be owned by you.
