#summary The freighter moves around wares for your Dockware Manager

= Freighter =

A simple command, the Freighter is designed to work with your dock and the dock's source stations.  Freighters should be homebased to a dock. Once the command is run, they'll use your Dockware Manager's _source_ information to figure out where to get wares required for the dock.  See the sources section of [Feature_Dockware_Manager Dockware Manager].

They'll also pay attention to threshold limits on those specified sources so that your freighters aren't making multiple runs, wasting fuel, just to pick up a few wares.  See the thresholds section of [Feature_Dockware_Manager Dockware Manager].
