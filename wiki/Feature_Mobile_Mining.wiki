#summary LU Mobile Mining is different

= Mobile Mining In LU =

Here's the quick and dirty.  The Mobile Drilling Laser and Ore Collector has been re-purposed.  Hit a rock with your MDS, and you have a chance of your ore collector popping something into your cargo bay.  It's as simple as that.

=== Mobile Drilling System Is Different ===

Hitting a debris rock with the MDS is now they to mine.  When the debris rock is hit, there is a chance for a mineral or crystal to be "loosened".  The Ore Collector will beam the loosened material into the cargo bay, which all happens automatically.

Only the new miner variant of ships can actually equip MDS lasers.

=== Rare Minerals and Crystals ===

Most of the time when you hit a rock, you'll get a mineral like ore, silicon, ice, or nividium.  Rarely, you'll end up with a rare mineral or crystal.

Outposts throughout the galaxy will buy these rare minerals and crystals.  These docks consume at a high rate.



Mineral || Chance || Price
Red Mineral || 54% || 23423

There will be NPC miners out there who also mine and sell to mining outposts.

About the mobile mining stuff, the wiki is quite vague : 

1 Do the MDS "eats up" the rocks it hits ? Can they completly empty a sector of small rocks ? (if yes, do the rocks respawn ?) 

2 How the yield of the rocks affect the collecting rate ? 

3 Do they need to hit small rocks or can they be used on big asteroids ? (if small rocks only, do the ships break them down to the size they need ?) 

4 How many miners can hit the same rock ? 

5 As it's laser based, does it work better/worse OOS ?


1: Yes. Depending on the size, a rock can only take so many hits 
2: The higher the yield, the higher the chance of yielding more valuable items 
3: Any size debris hit with an MDS can yield 
4: As many miners as you want can hit the same rock. Even different races. 
5: I pained to ensure OOS mining and IS mining is performed at the same pace
