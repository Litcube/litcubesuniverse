#summary LU Mobile Mining is different

= Mobile Mining In LU =

Here's the quick and dirty.  The Mobile Drilling Laser and Ore Collector has been re-purposed.  Hit a rock with your MDS, and you have a chance of your ore collector popping something into your cargo bay.  It's as simple as that.

Only the new miner variant of ships can actually equip them.

Most of the time when you hit a rock, you'll get a mineral like ore, silicon, ice, or nividium.  Rarely, you'll end up with a rare mineral or crystal.

Outposts throughout the galaxy will buy these rare minerals and crystals.  These docks consume at a high rate.

There will be NPC miners out there who also mine and sell to mining outposts.
