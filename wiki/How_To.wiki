=== How to Export (and Import) Your Game ===
You know how you groan every time you hear the suggestion, "Start a new game"? It is a pain to lose all of your hard-won empire. Not anymore; with LU!

*Before you Begin:*
  # Remove your cash from the Stock Market.
  # Make sure your marines are all on board ships.
  # Be in a safe sector.
  # Complete or cancel any ongoing missions.
  # Wait for all HQ queues (repair, recycle, production) to finish.
  # (Optional but Good Practice): Back up your entire LU folder.

*Do the Export/Import:*
  # First, *back up* your current game folder. Let's assume that your game is in C:\Games\LU. Copy the LU folder to "C:\Games\LU-OLD".
  # You should now have two folders:
    * LU       <== This will become your *new* folder.
    * LU-OLD   <== This will become your *old* folder.
  # Read the changelog for the patch
  # Patch the "LU" folder to the new version.
  # Copy the addon\scripts\Z.EmpireCopy.Export.xml from your *new* folder to your *old* folder addon\scripts\.  It will ask to overwrite.
  # Double-click LU-OLD\X3AP_n.exe to start the *old* game.
  # Load the saved game that you want to export.
  # *Export your game* by selecting "Export empire" in the Player Console (hotkey found in "Interface" in controls menu). This will create a log file in documents\Egosoft\X3AP called Log08382.txt.  
  # This can take a few minutes.  You can watch your log file increase in size if you're looking at it in windows explorer.
  # Exit X3.
  # Copy the log file (Log08382.txt) to the *new* LU\addon\t folder.
  # Rename the log file to 8382-L044.xml.
  # Start a new game in your *new* folder  (Double-click LU\X3AP_n.exe). Choose the _Damyath Import_ start. 
  # Enjoy a beverage of your choice as LU rebuilds your universe.

This will import your assets from your previous game into your new game start. Nice, huh? 

_Note: You might have to re-start some commands on some ships, especially if you are using 3rd-party scripts that are not yet supported by Export/Import. So check your Property sheet (r) carefully._
