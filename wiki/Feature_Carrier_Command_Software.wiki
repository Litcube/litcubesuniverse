#summary Carrier Command Software now enables teleport docking

= Carrier Command Software Update =

The carrier command software now enables a carrier to quickly dock incoming fighters.  When an incoming fighter gets within a certain range (roughly 5k), the ship is teleported to the carrier with a jump effect.

CCS only works on huge ships (M7 and up).
