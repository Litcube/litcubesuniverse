#summary Carrier Command Software now enables teleport docking

= Carrier Command Software Update =

The carrier command software now enables a carrier to quickly dock incoming fighters.  When an incoming fighter gets within a certain range (roughly 5k), the ship is teleported to the carrier with a jump effect.

CCS only works on huge ships (M7 and up).

In addition to this feature, the software opens up a command called Carrier Command, allowing the quick action on all homebased fighters.

Homebased ships will only be actioned if it has the appropriate upgrades for the requested command, reflected in the _available_ column of the menu.
