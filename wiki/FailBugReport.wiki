You're seeing this page because you reported a bug, question, or request that meets one or more of the following criteria.  The post should have told you at which of the following we failed to prevent you from failing:

  # Not enough enough information for me to reproduce
  # Failed to post a save game
  # Failed to post an export file
  # Your game is not Litcube's Universe Vanilla (LUV)
  # You haven't sated if your game is Litcube's Universe Vanilla (LUV)
  # Your _bug report_ is conjecture / guess work / untested hypothesis
  # I know what you're reporting, and it's not a bug
  # There's wiki info that answers your question / bug
  # Your request is far from the spirit of LU
  # (sincerely:) This is a bug worth reporting, thank you!
