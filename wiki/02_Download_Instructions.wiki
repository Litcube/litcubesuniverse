= Installation Instructions =
  # Start with a vanilla installation of X3AP. Best Practice is to copy from your Steam folder to somewhere else, such as C:\Games\X3LU. Use the no_Steam.exe (X3AP_n.exe) from the Bonus Downloads section of the EgoSoft forum.
  # Delete all files in addon\scripts.  
  # Go to the <wiki:comment>[https://www.mediafire.com/folder/6rwhzymiq3jy2/LU LU Download Site]</wiki:comment> Download Site. Download at least LU.zip and the latest patch.
  # Copy contents of LU.zip to your X3LU folder.  
  # Download the latest patch and do the same.

= Other Files in the Download Folder =

  * JobsEditor.zip = This is a spreadsheet for editing Jobs. Jobs in LU has a different format than in the vanilla game, so you *must* edit Jobs with this editor. X3Editor will not work for LU Jobs.

  * LETE.zip = Litcube's Excel TShips Editor. This spreadsheet is for editiing ships and related files. It works with vanilla TC/AP as well as LU.

  * Weapons Editor:  In the form of LETE, but for simultaneous Laser and Bullet editing

  * Missile Editor:  In the form of LETE, but for missiles.

  * Litcubes Universe Map.png = SPOILER ALERT: Map of the LU 'verse.
