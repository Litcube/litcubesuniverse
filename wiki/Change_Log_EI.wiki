*Notes on this version*
  * Exporting from less than LU1.3.5 to newer version:  
    * 1) Bad news: Your ships will not autostart, you will have to reissue new commands and ensure cargo bays are empty.
    * 1) Good news: From version LU1.3.5 on, several scripts will autostart after an EI (see patch notes)
    * 2) Bad news: If you have [http://forum.egosoft.com/viewtopic.php?t=336717 this] script installed, your EI will fail.  You'll have to remove the escape codes manually using a text editor.
    * 2) Good news: From version LU1.3.5 on, the EI properly strips this error out.
    * 3) Bad news: MLCC will be uninstalled on all docks.
    * 3) Good news: From version LU1.3.5 on, MLCC is properly E/I'd.
