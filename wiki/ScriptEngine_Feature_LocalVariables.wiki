#summary Local Variable Object Support

= Local Variables =

In the standard X3AP Game the following objects supported script local variables:
 * Ship
 * Station
 * Sector (Since Version 2.5)

In LU (Since version 1.3.2) the following objects support local variables:
 * Ship
 * Station
 * Sector
 * Asteroid/Debris
 * Gate

Coming in LU 1.3.3 Race objects will support local variables, example:
{{{
 $Race = [Argon]
 $Race->set local variable: name='test' value=42
 $Value = $Race->get local variable: name='test'
 write to player logbook $Value

 Output:
     42
