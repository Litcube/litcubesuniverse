#summary The higher your fight rank, the more ships drop stuff.

= FLC =

F.L.C. stands for Fightrank Loot Chance.  It's demonstrated as a percentage, which is the chance that an item on a ship will be dropped in a container as opposed to being destroyed with the ship.

This chance is checked per component on the ship.  So if you just popped a pirate M5 that had 6 IREs, and your FLC is 1.2%, there's a 1.2% chance for _each_ IRE that it'll be dropped as loot.

This new rule comes into effect with anything you or your owned ships kill, in sector or out of sector.

Keep in mind:

FLC doesn't actually go above a visible amount until Rank 19 @ 15%.
