#summary Major Features of Litcube's Universe (LU)

= Major Features =


----

== New Models ==

I put this first on the features page, not for boasting purposes, but so you can see it and read it.  I can't take any credit for the models themselves, aside from scene fixes and racial turrets.  But you should read the feature page anyway.

See: [Feature_New_Models Feature: New Models]

----
