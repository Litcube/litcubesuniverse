==E/I (in general)==

(1.3.4 --> 1.3.5.2) MLCC not installed on docks after E/I ([https://www.dropbox.com/s/malylc062mez152/MLCC%20loss%20on%20docks.zip?dl=0 Saves and Export])

Tug doesn't restart ([https://www.dropbox.com/s/2njkifwj6kr5adl/X02.sav?dl=0 Pre-Export Save] | [https://www.dropbox.com/s/zikv9tbg3fw96zp/X03.sav?dl=0 Post-Export Save] | [https://www.dropbox.com/s/r8pxk19zr9r5pip/8382-L044.xml?dl=0 Export File])

Freighters/Dock Agents ignore wares in cargo from pre-export, meaning they can be useless after E/I without manual intervention (full cargo, maybe same cleanup as ST/UT?) ([https://www.dropbox.com/s/2njkifwj6kr5adl/X02.sav?dl=0 Pre-Export Save] | [https://www.dropbox.com/s/zikv9tbg3fw96zp/X03.sav?dl=0 Post-Export Save] | [https://www.dropbox.com/s/r8pxk19zr9r5pip/8382-L044.xml?dl=0 Export File]))

Ships moved to player owned station by import still show on sector map as undocked (Both IS and OOS) ([https://www.dropbox.com/s/2njkifwj6kr5adl/X02.sav?dl=0 Pre-Export Save] | [https://www.dropbox.com/s/zikv9tbg3fw96zp/X03.sav?dl=0 Post-Export Save] | [https://www.dropbox.com/s/r8pxk19zr9r5pip/8382-L044.xml?dl=0 Export File] | [http://imgur.com/a/mQG1M#0 Screenshots])

E/I forces lasertowers to go through setup phase again

==Gameplay==

Using remote claim software, menu range is 5k while hotkey range is 4k ([https://www.dropbox.com/s/y5v7il92gs1y0qu/X07.sav?dl=0 Save])

Templates saving wrong number of energy cells (templated ship has 990, set to refuel to 1000, template puts 400 in cargo) ([https://www.dropbox.com/s/9zfa88l2m5jepdp/X01.sav?dl=0 Save])

OCV Target sound (foghorn) plays in all sectors

MLCC targeting bailed ships ([https://www.dropbox.com/s/hv4p5yx3zcx8kbz/MLCC%20targeting%20bailed%20ships.zip?dl=0 Save])

==Debug Messages==

ARRAY message relating to turret commands when applying a template. Screenshot shows applying template to Mandalay ([http://imgur.com/jTLD2Nn Screenshot])

Message from UT when refueling failed

==Mechanics/Polish==

Automatic Satellite deployment does not recognize Phanon as hostile, and therefore always gets destroyed when attempting to drop a sat in their home sector (maybe a sector/race/unknown sector blacklist feature?)

When re-installing MLCC, the additional command you ran it under flashes 'Unknown Command!" for a second in the slot you just used to install MLCC (fresh import from 1.3.4) ([https://www.dropbox.com/s/malylc062mez152/MLCC%20loss%20on%20docks.zip?dl=0 X02 Save in this zip])

Possible wonkiness in MLCC escort command. See tahl's description on skype (and if you need a save, I'll try to make one tomorrow night)
