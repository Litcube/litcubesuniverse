# FLC #

F.L.C. stands for Fightrank Loot Chance.  It's demonstrated as a percentage, which is the chance that an item on a ship will be dropped in a container as opposed to being destroyed with the ship.

This chance is checked per component on the ship.  So if you just popped a pirate M5 that had 6 IREs, and your FLC is 1.2%, there's a 1.2% chance for _each_ IRE that it'll be dropped as loot.

This new rule comes into effect with anything you or your owned ships kill, in sector or out of sector.
