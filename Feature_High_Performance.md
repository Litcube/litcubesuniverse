# High Performance #

Everything about LU is designed for speed. The overall "feel" is snappier and less prone to lag than the vanilla game.

I spent a considerable amount of effort in ensuring that the entire LU system was as fast as possible. The standards for what constitutes available content in the LU core package are high. To give you an idea of the achievements in this area, the vanilla game has around 7,500 tasks running concurrently. LU has roughly 16,000, and it's still the better performer.

One feature that is implemented that emphasizes the _feel_ of things is the new dynamic menu system implemented in scripts.  See: [Feature: Litcube's Dynamic Menu System](Feature_LU_Dynamic_Menu_System.md)
