The tug command is run on huge ships with a docking bay.  When run, the tug will stay docked at its homebase waiting for you to _flag_ a ship for it.  When the tug sees that you have _flagged a ship for tug_, it'll jump there, pick up the ship (and others you may have flagged in the sector), drop it off at the tug's homebase, and dock again.  This command makes capturing and recycling ships easy.  It's just another quick way to keep your shit together.

The menu that displays prior to operation allows you to configure strip functionality.  Stripping is a command run on a ship that removes all of its wares and onto the ship/station where it's docked.  Often, a tug is used to collect derelict ships which are stripped anyway.

**Strip functionality**

  * None:  No stripping performed
  * At homebase: Upon the tugged ships landing at the homebase, they are stripped.
  * On this ship:  Ships are stripped upon docking with the tug.

There's two ways to flag a ship for tug.

  * Use the hotkey when the ship to be tugged is targeted (under interface)
  * On the ship that needs to be tugged: run _Flag ship for tug_ from the _ship_.

Obviously, the ship to be tugged needs to be owned by you.
