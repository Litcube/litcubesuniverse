# Explorer Command Software #

_"The explorer software was designed by Teladi deep space researchers to enable remote entry and exploration of potentially hostile sectors without risking a pilot's life. Manned research vessels usually follow after the sector has proved to be safe."_

**Explore Universe**

Commands the ship to survey the current sector to map all stations, asteroids and gates. Once completed, the ship will attempt to map the next closest unknown sector via the safest path.

**Deploy Satellite Network**

The ship will place a configurable array of satellites within known sectors. When the definable number of stored satellites are used up, it will purchase fresh satellites and recommence placement.

**Scan Asteroids**

When you absolutely, positively need to know every roids' minerals in a sector.

**Fly Through Gate**

Does what it says on the tin.

Ships following these commands aim to follow safe routes where possible (e.g. when explorers move to sectors bordering un-mapped sectors). Note that a safe route requires you to **know** the actual route.  However, if there are no safe routes, they will take an unsafe route.


These command requirements can be found in the [Encyclopedia](Feature_Encyclopedia_Update.md). In each case, ships running this command will be auto-renamed and moved to the top of the Property Menu.
