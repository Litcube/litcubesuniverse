A template is a blueprint for the entire configuration of your ship including weapons, missile, turret commands, autojump configuration, emergency jump, ware resupply, and more.

When you hit the hotkey for the Template Manager (set in Controls, Interface), you will be able to "Save" a ship to the template manager. Select _Add template_, select a ship from the menu, and name the template.

Templates are used extensively throughout Litcube's Universe systems to automate refitting.  [Military Logistics & Command Software](Feature_MLCC.md), [Dockware Manager](Feature_Dockware_Manager.md) outfitting, and the [Supply Command Software](Feature_Supply_Command_Software.md) all use templates.
