# Rocky's Player Log (temetvince) #


---


First things first. What's my name? Oh yeah, Rocky. Check. Seems like I start in a ship, buzzard vanguard style, also with 4 kestrels around me and $300k.

And a man in an astronaut suit in front of me. He doesn't even have a laser. Hardcore. Let's see if I can pick him up by flying over him...

...Okay, that didn't work as expected. At least my windshield is now a pretty shade of red. Right before the collision, I caught sight of his namebadge. "Bullwinkle". RIP, Mr. Winkle.

Moving on...

1. Disable g19 display, enable Phanon and OCV

2. Wait for messages. 1st message.
Summary: OCV = Bad voodoo 2nd message.
Summary: Kyrdall Kormal, Chairman of TandiTech? Corp, is going down. Yeah, that's right, I'm talking to you, mister/missus/alien chairman/woman/thing! You just get comfortable in your headquarters over in... Unknown Sector nu, and I'll deal with you later!!!

3. Set 3 kestrels on explore, 1 on sats. Cool. Once kestrel is told to explore, its name automatically changes to explore kestrel! Wicked. Also, after mapping a sector, the kestrel automatically goes on to map another sector. Idk if this is normal in vanilla or not, but I like it regardless. Note on satellite dropper: I opted to have the kestrel remember last position. I have no clue what this means. We'll see if it screws it up any or not.

---

1st change: Box method of satellite dropping sucks. Wasted 2 sats, then stopped the kestrel and told him to use single sats. Much, much better. $$$.

Now that I've wasted some time in SETA making sure everything works properly, it's time to look for some combat missions!

---

Bought a damaged Toucan Hauler. The repair laser SUCKS. It's been a long time since I've played vanilla, but this seems significantly worse. Maybe it's just me. I took it down to 0% charge, went and heated up some soup. Ate the soup, etc. Gained 20% hull on my repair-work. :( Another 30% to go. This should only take another 30 mins...

Also, one of my kestrels is dead. Boy, the galaxy is a dangerous place! The only thing I can think of is that maybe all hits are 100% in OOS combat, because nothing should be able to hit one of those things whizzing by. Or perhaps the weapons are much faster in LU. Regardless, point taken: it's a dangerous world!

---

Satellites are expensive. I'm bankrupt.

Less satellites, more shooting things. Pew pew pew. I'll update when I can afford a higher word count.

---

Patrol/Destroy missions. Gaining some money, but not even back to $50k yet. Nabbed a Xenon M that bailed.

The repair laser is weird. It gets rid of my ships shields but heals hull. I ended up installing the marine repairs mod. I didn't want to give in but it seemed to be a good alternative. Bought 2 crappy marines.

Future goals = using my toucan hauler as a repair ship (marine transport) and possibly as a UT trader

---

Lost a 2nd kestrel to a pirate mamba. :(
But good grief! They've mapped soooo much. More than I ever did on any other play-through.

---

Bought a discoverer, 50% damage. Fixed it and sold it. Proffitttssss. Or something like that.

Also, sold my starting m4 and transferred into the Xenon M.

---

Another kestrel down. 1 left, and he's sitting in a military base awaiting permission to buy more satellites. The last one was due to a Xenon N

Still playing, still in my Xenon M. I've been following these general strategies:

1. Buy/fix/sell used ships that have <100% hull. If TS and I have $, make into UT.

2. Use Litcube's additions to the game to easily find wares from destroyed ships. Transporter device = amazing. Sell them.

3. Use Litcube's additions and my satellite network to find abandoned ships. I've found 3 thus far, I think. Sell them.

4.Continue fight missions. The fight missions have been the key to my early success.


Notes:

1. The repair laser rocks! Actually, way too over-powered. For some reason (perhaps the linux install?), the repair laser empties energy rapidly for me (a bug, according to litcube). However, I can just jump back in my ship and immediately eject again, with 100% laser. Even severely damaged TS's can be fixed quickly like this. This is exploitable and may need to be fixed; although it may work normally for windows users.

2. Fight missions are getting difficult. I'm not doing near as many of them. Upgrading to a large cargo hold M3 is going to happen soon. (Large cargo for holding found wares and also for energy cells for farther jumping)

3. I've over $3 million right now. Not much, but it's an improvement.


Goals:

I have 3 UTs; I want at least 5-10. More is better. I need to upgrade my m4 to m3. I'd also like to get a TL, probably a split elephant. My split race rep is not great with them (positive, though). So I'm going to send my only remaining kestrel to split space to deploy a sat network there, which should allow my UTs to slowly build up race rep through trade.

Updated note: The ghost of Bullwinkle told me used ships <75% hull are a good buy, not necessarily ships <100% as a whole.

So, that heavy centaur... yeah... boarded a Teladi pirate m6 and sold it. Went off rampaging through pirate sectors, ships bailed left and right. Bought a Yaki TM, collected ships, repair lasered them and sold them. Lots and lots of money. Upgraded all my UTs to have the jump drive thingy, and I'm also up to 9 of the suckers now. The jump drive thingy is AMAZING! :)
