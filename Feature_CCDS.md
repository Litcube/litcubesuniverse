# Chaff Countermeasure Defense System #

CCDS is a ship system that enables auto firing of chaff at incoming missiles.  There is no configuration required beyond equipping the ship with chaff, and of course having the respective CCDS system installed on the ship.  If the system is installed, the ship will track incoming missiles and fire chaff.

There are 3 variants; MK1, MK2, MK3.

The only difference between the three systems is who manufactures them, and in turn where they are purchased, and also the success rate the system has at intercepting the incoming missiles.

There is a random variable in the form of the pilot's flight skill, but other than that, the CCDS can intercept roughly 30%, 50%, 75% of incoming missiles for MK1, MK2, and MK3 variants respectively.

Installing this on a player ship is only useful if you don't plan on mapping your "fire chaff" hotkey like an idiot.  If you don't do it, because you're a giant fool, you can install a CCDS and have the CCDS do the firing for you, with the standard interception chances.
